A web application I made hosted using the Django framework.
Contains: html, css, javascript and python code.

1. The site needs Django installed in order to run, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/install/.
2. Once installed just open a terminal in the demo folder and run "py manage.py runserver".
3. Open localhost:8000 on any browser and enjoy.
